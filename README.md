This is a responsive website based on HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is a demonstartion of a movies website. I have demonstrated various genres in form of sections.
HTML is used to give basic structure or layout to the page.
CSS provides vibrant colors , font-families and style to the structure of code.
With the help of JavaScript I have added functionalities of changing the color of navigation items and navigation bar on hovering and scrolling.
Overall , it was a great learning experience for me in the field of Web Development.
